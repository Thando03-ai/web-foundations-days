# QuickNotes - System Design (Project 2)



This repository contains the QuickNotes API client and the system

design documents for scaling QuickNotes to 1 million users.



## API client



A small page that talks to the JSONPlaceholder practice API:

it loads notes (GET), creates notes (POST) and deletes notes (DELETE),

with loading, success, error and empty states.



**Run it:** clone the repo, open the folder in VS Code, right-click

`index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.



Note: JSONPlaceholder is a fake API - created notes are not really

saved on the server (see comments in `api.js`).



## Design documents

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)



## What I Learned



- How HTTP methods, status codes and JSON work together in a REST API

- How to use fetch with async/await, and why to check response.ok

- How to model users, notes and tags with primary and foreign keys

- Why caching, load balancers and read replicas help a read-heavy app

- That every design decision is a trade-off that should be explained
