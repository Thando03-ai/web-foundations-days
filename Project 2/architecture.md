# QuickNotes Architecture (1 Million Users)

## 1. Requirements

**Functional**

- Users can sign up and log in.

- Users can create, read, update, delete and search their notes.

- Notes sync across all of a user's devices.

**Non-functional**

- Note lists load in under 300 ms for most requests.

- 99.9% availability (under ~9 hours of downtime per year).

- Notes are never lost (backups + replication).

- Users can only ever see their own notes (security).

## 2. Load estimate

- 1,000,000 users, 20% daily active = 200,000 DAU.

- Writes: 200,000 × 5 notes = 1,000,000/day ≈ 10/s (peak ≈ 50/s).

- Reads: 200,000 × 20 loads = 4,000,000/day ≈ 40/s (peak ≈ 200/s).

- Storage: 1,000,000 notes/day × 500 bytes = 500 MB/day ≈ 180 GB/year.

- Conclusion: read-heavy (4:1), so caching and read replicas help most.

## 4. Components and the problem each solves

| Component | Problem it solves |

|---|---|

| DNS | Turns quicknotes.com into the IP addresses of our services. |

| CDN | Static files load fast worldwide and do not load our servers. |

| Load balancer (x2) | Spreads traffic, skips failed servers; standby avoids SPOF. |

| App servers (3+, stateless) | Add servers for more traffic; one can fail safely. |

| Cache (Redis) | Frequent reads (note lists) return in ~1 ms and spare the DB. |

| Primary database | Single source of truth for all writes. |

| Read replica(s) | Take read load off the primary; can be promoted if it fails. |

| Queue + worker | Slow jobs (emails, exports) run in the background. |

| Backups | Recover data after mistakes, bugs or disasters. |

## 5. Request flows

**GET /notes (load my notes)**

1. The client sends `GET /notes` with its token to the load balancer.

2. The load balancer forwards it to a healthy app server.

3. The app server checks the token and finds the user id (e.g. 1).

4. It looks in the cache for `notes:user:1`.

5. Cache hit: return the notes immediately (200 OK).

6. Cache miss: query a read replica, store the result in the cache

for 5 minutes (TTL), then return it (200 OK).

**POST /notes (create a note)**

1. The client sends `POST /notes` with the JSON body and token.

2. The load balancer forwards it to a healthy app server.

3. The app server checks the token and validates the data

(400 Bad Request if invalid).

4. It inserts the note into the **primary** database.

5. It deletes `notes:user:1` from the cache so the next read is fresh.

6. It returns 201 Created with the new note.

## 6. Trade-offs

1. **Freshness vs speed.** Reads come from the cache and replicas,

which can be a moment behind the primary. For a notes app this is

acceptable. To avoid confusion, the app shows the user's own new

note immediately from the POST response.

2. **Simplicity vs scale.** We chose read replicas and a cache rather

than sharding. Sharding is not needed at 180 GB/year and would add

a lot of complexity; we will revisit it if data grows 20-50×.

3. **Cost vs reliability.** Running two load balancers, three app

servers and a replica costs more than one server, but meets our

99.9% availability target.

## 7. Avoiding single points of failure

- Load balancers run as an active/standby pair.

- At least 3 stateless app servers; failed ones are removed by health checks.

- The primary database has a replica that can be promoted (failover).

- Nightly backups are stored separately from the database servers.

- The cache is an optimisation: if Redis fails, the app reads from the database (slower, but still working).
