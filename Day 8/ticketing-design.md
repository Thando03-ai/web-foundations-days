# TicketHub - Design Document



## 1. Requirements



**Functional**

- Browse and search events.

- See which seats are available for an event.

- Hold seats for 10 minutes while paying.

- Pay and receive tickets; view my tickets.



**Non-functional**

- A seat must NEVER be sold twice (correctness comes first).

- Survive big sales: ~3,300 requests/second for 10 minutes.

- Pages load in under 1 second on normal days.

- Fairness: people who arrive first get the first chance to buy.



## 2. Estimates

- Normal: 50,000 visitors × 10 pages = 500,000/day ≈ 5 requests/s.

- Big sale: 200,000 people × ~10 requests in 600 s ≈ 3,300 requests/s.

- Only 20,000 seats exist, so at most 20,000 orders can succeed;

  180,000 people will not get a ticket and must be told quickly.



## 3. API

- GET  /events?search=&city=      list and search events (200)

- GET  /events/{id}                event details (200)

- GET  /events/{id}/seats          seats with their status (200)

- POST /holds                      body: { "eventId": 7, "seatIds": [101, 102] }

                                   → 201 with holdId and expiry time,

                                   → 409 Conflict if a seat is taken

- POST /orders                     body: { "holdId": 55, "paymentToken": "..." }

                                   → 201 Created (tickets issued)

- GET  /me/tickets                 my tickets (200)



409 Conflict means the request clashes with the current state

(the seat is no longer available).



## 4. Data model

- users   (id, name, email UNIQUE, password_hash)

- events  (id, name, venue, starts_at)

- seats   (id, event_id FK → events, section, row, number,

           status: 'available' | 'held' | 'sold',

           hold_id, hold_expires_at,

           UNIQUE (event_id, section, row, number))

- orders  (id, user_id FK → users, event_id FK → events,

           total, status, created_at)

- order_seats (order_id FK → orders, seat_id FK → seats UNIQUE)



Relationships: an event has many seats (one-to-many); a user has many

orders (one-to-many); an order contains many seats, and each seat can

belong to at most one order - enforced by UNIQUE on order_seats.seat_id.



## 5. Preventing double-booking

Holding a seat uses a single conditional update inside a transaction:



    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    UPDATE seats

    SET status = 'held', hold_id = 55,

        hold_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '10 minutes'

    WHERE id IN (101, 102) AND event_id = 7

      AND (status = 'available'

           OR (status = 'held' AND hold_expires_at < NOW()));

    -- if fewer than 2 rows changed, someone else got a seat first:

    ROLLBACK;  -- and reply 409 Conflict

    -- otherwise:

    COMMIT;    -- and reply 201 Created



Because the database checks the status and changes it in one atomic

step, two buyers can never both succeed for the same seat: the second

update finds the seat already 'held' and changes nothing. The UNIQUE

constraint on order_seats.seat_id is a second safety net. Expired holds

become available again automatically, because the WHERE clause treats

them like available seats.



## 6. Architecture



    Browser ──> CDN (event pages, images, CSS, JS)

       │

       v

    Load balancer ──> Waiting room (virtual queue)

                           │  lets ~2,000 buyers in at a time

                           v

               App servers (auto-scaled for the sale)

                 │               │                │

                 v               v                v

          Cache (Redis):   Primary DB          Payment provider

          event pages,     (seats, orders -    (external service)

          seat map         all holds and

          (short TTL)      purchases here)

                                 │

                                 v

                          Read replicas (browsing, search)

                                 │

                   Queue ──> Workers (ticket emails, PDFs)



- CDN: event pages and images are identical for everyone, so they

  are served from the edge during the rush.

- Waiting room: during a big sale, visitors join a virtual queue

  and are let in at a rate the system can handle, in arrival order.

  This protects the database and is fair.

- Load balancer + auto-scaled stateless app servers: extra servers

  are added before a known big sale and removed afterwards.

- Cache: the seat map is cached for a few seconds to absorb millions

  of views; the final check always happens in the database.

- Primary database: the only place seats are held and sold, so the

  transaction guarantees correctness.

- Read replicas: handle browsing and search so the primary can focus

  on holds and orders.

- Queue + workers: ticket emails and PDFs are created in the

  background after payment, keeping checkout fast.



## 7. Trade-offs

1. Correctness over availability for purchases: holds and orders

   always go to the primary database, even if that means some buyers

   wait or see "try again". Selling a seat twice would be far worse.

2. Freshness vs speed for the seat map: the cached map may be a few

   seconds out of date, so a seat that looks free may already be held.

   The buyer then gets a 409 and picks another seat - acceptable,

   because the final check is always correct.

3. Fairness vs simplicity: the waiting room adds complexity, but

   without it the fastest bots and refreshers would win, and the

   spike could overload the system.

Step 3 - Understand the central idea. The key insight is that correctness is guaranteed by the database, not by the app servers or the cache. The conditional UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'available' checks and changes the seat in one atomic step, so even if thousands of servers try at the same moment, only one can succeed for each seat. Everything else in the design - the CDN, the cache, the waiting room - exists to keep the huge crowd away from that critical step so it stays fast.

Fairness vs simplicity: the waiting room adds complexity, but without it the fastest bots and refreshers would win, and the spike could overload the system. ``
